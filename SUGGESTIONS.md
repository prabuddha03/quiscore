# Suggestions for Incorporating Redis

Here are some suggestions for other places Redis can be incorporated into your application to improve performance, scalability, and add real-time features.

### 1. Caching Database Queries

For frequently accessed data that doesn't change often, you can cache the results of database queries. This would reduce the load on your PostgreSQL database and speed up response times.

**Examples:**

- Cache user profiles.
- Cache event details, especially for popular or ongoing events.
- Cache scoreboard data, which can be expensive to calculate.

You can implement a simple caching function like this:

```typescript
import { redis } from "./lib/redis";
import { prisma } from "./lib/prisma";

async function getCachedEvent(eventId: string) {
  const cacheKey = `event:${eventId}`;
  const cachedEvent = await redis.get(cacheKey);

  if (cachedEvent) {
    return JSON.parse(cachedEvent);
  }

  const event = await prisma.event.findUnique({ where: { id: eventId } });
  if (event) {
    // Cache for 15 minutes
    await redis.setex(cacheKey, 900, JSON.stringify(event));
  }

  return event;
}
```

### 2. Real-time Features with Pub/Sub

Redis has a powerful Publish/Subscribe feature that you can use for real-time communication.

- **Live Scoreboard Updates:** When a score changes, you can publish a message to a Redis channel. All connected clients subscribed to that channel would receive the update in real-time. Your application already uses Socket.IO. You can use the `socket.io-redis` adapter to scale your real-time infrastructure across multiple server instances.

- **Real-time Notifications:** Send notifications to users about event updates, new messages, or other important events.

### 3. Rate Limiting

You can use Redis to implement rate limiting to protect your API from abuse. For each incoming request, you can increment a counter in Redis for a user's IP address or API key. If the count exceeds a certain threshold within a time window, you can block the request. This is crucial for protecting your service from DoS attacks.

### 4. Job Queues

For long-running tasks, you can use Redis as a message broker for a job queue. This prevents blocking the main application and improves user experience.

**Examples:**

- Generating complex reports or analytics.
- Sending batch emails or notifications.
- Processing uploaded data, like a CSV of participants.

You can use libraries like `BullMQ` or `Celery` (with a Python worker) to implement a robust job queue system with Redis.

### 5. Leaderboards

Redis's Sorted Sets are a perfect data structure for implementing leaderboards. You can store user scores in a sorted set, and Redis will automatically keep them ordered by score. This makes it very fast to retrieve the top N users for a leaderboard. For your `quiscore` app, this is an excellent fit for displaying real-time rankings in a competition.

**Example with ioredis:**

```typescript
import Redis from "ioredis";
const redis = new Redis(); // Your redis connection

async function addUserScore(eventId: string, userId: string, score: number) {
  await redis.zadd(`leaderboard:${eventId}`, score, userId);
}

async function getTopUsers(eventId: string, count: number) {
  // Get top users with scores, highest score first
  return await redis.zrevrange(
    `leaderboard:${eventId}`,
    0,
    count - 1,
    "WITHSCORES"
  );
}
```
